#Bus Watcher
##Overview
Imagine you are waiting anxiously at the bus stop, but the bus never seems to come. We made an app to ease your anxiety. With Bus Watcher, you can get real time data about the position of the closest incoming bus of your selected route. The data is pulled from official bus website, so it's very credible!

The data of bus route names and stop names are stored in local storage to achieve maximun data transfer rate. Currently the database only has data for Q18 route.But more data will be added in future updates. Thanks for your patience.
